# Taste-of-Culture

<p>Our food reflects our unique cultures and histories. Increasing cultural homogenization means that not only are our dishes at risk of extinction, but also the culture, practices and stories that conjure them. These include the stories of the food we eat during special occasions, or treasured family recipes passed down through generations. Our app aims to archive and preserve these stories, promote them across national boundaries, and connect people to build communities through which such heritage can subsist. </p>
<br>
<p>Our app integrates a storytelling feature in its recipe-sharing interface which provides a platform for people to share personal and culturally-rooted stories behind their recipes. Moreover, we stimulate regional and family connections via event-hosting functions, location-sharing, messaging, virtual learning, and social media elements (likes, comments, shares).</p>

<h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Preserve family heritage: archive stories and recipes online</li>
    <li>Promote cross-cultural understanding: cultivate interest in culinary heritages </li>
